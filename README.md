My practice stuff regarding Tweepy. 

Tweepy is interesting and amazing python library for twitter. 

A while ago I used TextBlob for Tweet sentiment analysis, where i didnt save any tweet in DB.

Now, My 1st task was to save Tweets in Mongodb (NoSQL, always a better option), and then work out with the tweets saved.
