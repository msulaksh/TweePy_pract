After I had tweets stored in mongodb, I started working on filtering those tweets.
Firstly, I started with simple db.find() command.

db.twitter_search.find({'entities.user_mentions.name':"Karl Smith"})         # check for different quotation marks used for Key and value.
									                                                           # with this working, add .count() and .pretty()
